## Interview Practice & Contribution Platform
**Project Description**

This project is a Java-based object-oriented system that models an interview preparation platform. Users can view and answer interview questions, submit new questions for approval, and track their progress over time. The system supports multiple user roles (such as Admin and Contributor), includes a submission review process, and incorporates gamification features like points, ranks, and badges.

The project demonstrates core object-oriented design principles including inheritance, encapsulation, role-based behavior, and separation of responsibilities through well-structured classes and UML modeling.
